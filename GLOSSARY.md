# orch-it

The orchestration layer: Claude sessions, scripts and GitHub working tickets in a repo. Its work is read and fixed
from its events, never from a new hand measurement.

## Events

**Event**:
One fact of the layer's work at one moment, written once and never changed.
_Avoid_: log line, record, entry

**Kind**:
The name of what an event is, one of a closed list.
_Avoid_: type, event type, category

**Envelope**:
The fields every event has whatever its kind.
_Avoid_: header, metadata, common fields

**Detail**:
The fields of an event beyond its envelope, particular to its kind; their set stays open.
_Avoid_: payload, data, extra

**Step pair**:
The two events of a step that takes time, its start and its end, under one step id.
_Avoid_: span, interval, duration event

**Outcome**:
How a step ended, one of a closed set.
_Avoid_: status, result, verdict

**Reason code**:
A word from the closed list beside a field, saying why.
_Avoid_: reason text, cause, message

## Storage

**Store**:
All the events of one machine, for every repo on it.
_Avoid_: database, event log

**Writer**:
One process that adds events to the store.
_Avoid_: producer, emitter, logger

**Index**:
The queryable copy of a store, derived from it alone.
_Avoid_: cache table, read model
